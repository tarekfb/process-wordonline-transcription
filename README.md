# process-wordonline-transcription
## A js tool for processing a Word Online transcription. Written to automate part of bachelor thesis.

8 interviews were conducted while writing my bachelor theses. These were ran through Word Online's transcribe feature: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/transcribe-your-recordings-7fc2efec-245e-45f0-b053-2a97531ecf57.


But they lacked formatting. This fixes that. Only written to speed up my process of writing bachelor thesis, therefore some code is hard-coded or hastily written.
